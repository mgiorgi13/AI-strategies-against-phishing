\chapter*{Abstract}
This paper explores advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for detecting and preventing phishing attacks, a growing threat in the digital landscape. It reviews three AI-based approaches: an Embedded Phishing Detection Browser (EPDB) using Machine Learning (ML), a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for URL-based phishing detection, and a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Transformers for analyzing both URLs and web page content. Each method is evaluated for its effectiveness, considering factors like dataset size, model accuracy, precision, recall, and scalability. The EPDB model demonstrates the highest accuracy on a smaller dataset, while the GAN approach shows potential for handling large-scale data. The hybrid model effectively balances speed and accuracy by combining URL analysis with partial content inspection. The paper concludes by discussing potential improvements, including dataset expansion and integrating the strengths of each model for enhanced phishing detection.
